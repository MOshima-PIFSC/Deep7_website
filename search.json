Many of the priorities have come directly from suggestions from fishers. Some of our top priorities currently include:\n\n\n\n\n\nRefining non-commercial catch estimates using fisher numbers, commercial reports, and surveys.\n\n\n\n\nExpanding biosampling by partnering with fishers to collect life history and length data.\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing the BFISH survey by reevaluating fishing methods and sampling grid allocations.\n\n\n\n\nReassessing the Deep 7 Stock complex and investigating alternative groupings.\n\n\n\n\nAnd more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet the team behind the work\nThe members of the Island Fisheries Stock Assessment Program at the Pacific Island Fisheries Science Center are working on the modules for the research track.\n\n\n\n\nJohn Syslo is the lead assessment scientist for the Deep 7 Bottomfish.
