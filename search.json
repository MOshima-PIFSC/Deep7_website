    "text": "The meeting was held at Pier 38 on March 20, 2025. The following summarizes the discussions that were had during the meeting.\nPresentation on PIFSC Deep 7 Research Track Discussion Questions:\n\nThoughts on the process so far?\nDoes the approach address concerns about stock assessments?\nAre there challenges or uncertainties that need clarification?\n\nDiscussion on Including Uku vs. Deep 7:\n\nPotential to merge if resources allow and commonalities exist.\nUku has its own research (e.g., uku mail survey) that could inform catch understanding in Deep 7.\nSome argue uku should be included since expert fishermen see similarities with Deep 7.\nConcerns about lack of transparency in uku single-species assessments.\nDeep 7 assessments rely on commercial catch and assumptions about recreational catch.\nIssues with reporting and tracking quotas, especially for Kona crab.\nQuestions raised about the rationale behind shark depredation tracking and quota management.\n\nChallenges in Combining Uku and the Deep 7 into the Same Research Track:\n\nDifferent commercial-to-noncommercial catch ratios.\nUku involves more kayak, nearshore, and spearfishing, making noncommercial catch difficult to capture.\nCommercial fishers bear the main regulatory burden.\n\nRecognition and Concerns about Data & Species Complexity:\n\nSome applaud the group for its recognized groundbreaking work.\nConcerns remain over the push to separate species into subcomplexes or single-species assessments.\nIssues with poor data—analysis is ineffective if the data itself is flawed.\nNeed for enforcement on reporting recreational catches.\nMainland fisheries have more targeted species management compared to island fisheries.\n\nData System and Reporting Issues:\n\nPlans to revamp the data system exist, but the timeline is unclear.\nConsiderations about how grouping species affects assessments.\nSuggestion to provide a broad overview of the rationale behind assessment changes.\nWorking groups discussing best approaches to assessments and management.\n\nConcerns About Small Fishery Size and Data Limitations:\n\nSingle-species management may be correct in theory but difficult in practice.\nSome species, like paka, migrate and fluctuate in availability over cycles.\nQuestion raised about whether other regions’ recreational fishing assessments can offer insights.\nLarge numbers of recreational fishers make assessments challenging.\n\nMRIP and Noncommercial Data Collection:\n\nOngoing efforts to refine MRIP data, considering regional and national objectives.\nSome regions acknowledge MRIP’s shortcomings.\nSuggestion to use the bottomfish registry to collect noncommercial data.\nTesting this approach with uku.\n\nNoncommercial Catch & Catch Limits:\n\nQuestions about whether noncommercial catch is too high since ACLs haven’t been met.\nConcerns that refining noncommercial estimates could impact catch limits.\nPatterns show noncommercial fishers go out only during favorable conditions, while commercial fishers operate year-round.\nSeasonal and cyclical variations in catches noted, particularly for paka.\n\nShark Depredation & Fishing Behavior Changes:\n\nIncreasing shark depredation is affecting fishing behavior.\nQuestion raised about whether assessments account for these changes.\n\nBottomfish Vessel Registry (BFVR) Method Presentation by DAR/PIFSC Issues with Registration & Catch Estimates:\n\nChallenges with boat registration and removing old boats from records.\nThe number of boats is easier to track than individual fishers.\nQuestions about why noncommercial fishers appear to catch similar amounts as commercial fishers.\nPossible overestimation of noncommercial fishers due to unnecessary registrations.\nConcerns that some fishers register despite not targeting Deep 7.\nLong-standing complaints about reliance on MRIP interviews for catch estimates.\n\nUnderreported Commercial Catch & Data Assumptions:\n\nAcknowledgment that commercial catch is underreported across islands.\nIssues with assumptions in data cutoffs used for assessments.\nSuggestion to directly ask BFVR participants about their catches.\nPotential for uku mail survey to help refine data.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nProposal to meet in a few weeks to address decision points for analysis.\nNew MRIP Approach presentation postponed until next meeting due to time constraints\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "a formal process that allows NOAA scientists the opportunity to dive deeper into our scientific approaches and improve how we assess and manage our fisheries.\n\n\n\n\nnot limited by strict management deadlines.\n\n\n\n\na collaborative process with fishers, state scientists, and federal scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Deep 7 Research Track is\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research track is made up of several different research modules.\nThere are many avenues of research we want to explore over the next few years to improve the Deep 7 assessment. Many of the priorities have come directly from suggestions from fishers. Some of our top priorities currently include:\n\n\n\n\n\nRefining non-commercial catch estimates using fisher numbers, commercial reports, and surveys.\n\n\n\n\nExpanding biosampling by partnering with fishers to collect life history and length data.\n\n\n\n\nEnhancing the BFISH survey by reevaluating fishing methods and sampling grid allocations.\n\n\n\n\nReassessing the Deep 7 Stock complex and investigating alternative groupings.\n\n\n\n\nAnd more!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can I get involved?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will be hosting regular meetings to share our progress and get your input.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to catch up on what happened at previous meetings, click here.\n\n\n\n\nWe would love to hear from you, reach out to us at (insert email or some contact method here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
