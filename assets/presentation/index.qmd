## Outline

1. The Process
2. What is a research track?
3. Research Topics

# The Process

## The process is for you -- A collaborative approach {.smaller}

The Deep 7 Research Track is built on your knowlege & experience:

- **A Shared Goal:** Sustainable fisheries that support livelihoods and future generations. 
- **Your Role Matters:** This is not a top-down decision-making process - your feedback shapes how we improve stock assessments. 
- **Respecting Local Knowledge:** You know the ocean and the fish - you help make the science stronger. 
- **Collaborative Process:** Fishers, Federal and State agencies all have a voice. 

## Why your Partcipation is essential{.smaller}

We need your expertise

- **Understanding Changes in Fishing:** You see changes firsthand - this helps refine our analysis. 
- **Corroborate the Data:** Science is stronger when it aligns with your observations. 
- **Informing Better Management:** Your input ensures assessments reflect real-world fishing conditions. 
- **This is a Conversation:** We want to hear what you think at every step. 

# What is a Research Track?

## Why do we need this? {.smaller}

Fisheries are always changing

**Fishing is Not Like It Used to Be:**  

The ocean, the fish, and the way we fish have all changed over time.

<br>**The Ocean is Always Changing**

Weather, climate, and habitat shifts impact fish stocks and where they are found.

<br>**We Need to Keep Up**

Stock assessments must evolve so we can continue to fish sustainably and ensure a future for everyone.

<br>**What is a Research Track?**

It’s a deep dive into our scientific approach to improve how we assess and manage fisheries.

<br>**Why Does It Matter?**

Better science means better fisheries. It helps keep stocks healthy for the future.

<br>**How Is It Different?**

Instead of just updating old numbers, this looks at new data and better ways to count fish.

## How is this Different? {.smaller}

Management Track, What we have in place.

- **Mandated to Provide Stock Assessments Every 3 Years**

- **Focus:** Routine updates to inform fishery management decisions (e.g., Catch limits)

- **Goal:** Provide the best available science within strict timelines for management decision-making

Research Track, What We are Introducing.


- **A More Comprehensive & Flexible Approach** 

- **Not Limited by Management Deadlines** – Allows for deeper investigation and innovation 

- **Purpose:** 
  - Explore new methods & improve assessment models 
  - Evaluate transitions (e.g., complex-level to single-species assessments) 

- **Not Immediately Used for Management** – Instead, research track findings feed 
  into future management track assessments

# Research Topics 


## Topics {.smaller}


::: {.panel-tabset}

## Non-Commerical Catch

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![](img/Topics1_1.jpg){width="20%"}
:::
**Refining Non-Commercial Catch Estimates**

- Develop and evaluate alternative scenarios for non-commercial (NC) Deep 7 catch.

- Use fisher numbers, commercial reports, and surveys to refine estimates.


## Biosampling

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![](img/Topics1_2.jpg){width="20%"}
:::
**Expanding biosampling**

- Partner with fishers to collect life history and fish length data.

- Ensure comprehensive spatial coverage of bottomfish fisheries.


## BFISH

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![](img/Topics1_3.jpg){width="20%"}
:::

**Enhancing the BFISH survey**

- Reevaluate fishing methods and sampling grid allocation.

## Deep 7

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
![](img/Topics1_4.jpg){width="20%"}
:::

**Reassessing the Deep 7 Stock Complex**

- Investigate whether Deep 7 species should be assessed as a single complex.

- Determine the optimal assessment structure (single-species vs. subgroup models).

## Misc

**Potential future topics**

- Under-reporting of commercial catch
- Shark depredation
- New ways of analyzing catch-per-unit-effort
- Other ideas?
