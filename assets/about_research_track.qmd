The Deep 7 Research Track is
:::

a formal process that allows NOAA scientists the opportunity to dive deeper into our scientific approaches and improve how we assess and manage our fisheries.

not limited by strict management deadlines.

a collaborative process with fishers, state scientists, and federal scientists.  

::::


# The research track is made up of several different research modules.  

There are many avenues of research we want to explore over the next few years to improve the Deep 7 assessment. Many of the priorities have come directly from suggestions from fishers. Some of our top priorities currently include:

:::{.progress-block}
Refining non-commercial catch estimates using fisher numbers, commercial reports, and surveys. @cr-myimage

Expanding biosampling by partnering with fishers to collect life history and length data.

Enhancing the BFISH survey by reevaluating fishing methods and sampling grid allocations.  

Reassessing the Deep 7 Stock complex and investigating alternative groupings.  

And more!
