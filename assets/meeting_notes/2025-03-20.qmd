title: "New Methods for Non-Commerical Catch"
---
The meeting was held at Pier 38 on March 20, 2025. The following summarizes the discussions that were had during the meeting.  

**Presentation on PIFSC Deep 7 Research Track Discussion Questions:**

* Thoughts on the process so far?  

* Does the approach address concerns about stock assessments?  

* Are there challenges or uncertainties that need clarification?  

**Discussion on Including Uku vs. Deep 7:**

* Potential to merge if resources allow and commonalities exist.  

* Uku has its own research (e.g., uku mail survey) that could inform catch understanding in Deep 7.  

* Some argue uku should be included since expert fishermen see similarities with Deep 7.  

* Concerns about lack of transparency in uku single-species assessments.  

* Deep 7 assessments rely on commercial catch and assumptions about recreational catch.  
 
* Issues with reporting and tracking quotas, especially for Kona crab.  

* Questions raised about the rationale behind shark depredation tracking and quota management.  

**Challenges in Combining Uku and the Deep 7 into the Same Research Track:**

* Different commercial-to-noncommercial catch ratios.  

* Uku involves more kayak, nearshore, and spearfishing, making noncommercial catch difficult to capture.  


* Commercial fishers bear the main regulatory burden.  


**Recognition and Concerns about Data & Species Complexity:**


* Some applaud the group for its recognized groundbreaking work.  

* Concerns remain over the push to separate species into subcomplexes or single-species assessments.  

* Issues with poor data—analysis is ineffective if the data itself is flawed.  

* Need for enforcement on reporting recreational catches.  

* Mainland fisheries have more targeted species management compared to island fisheries.


**Data System and Reporting Issues:**

* Plans to revamp the data system exist, but the timeline is unclear.

* Considerations about how grouping species affects assessments.

* Suggestion to provide a broad overview of the rationale behind assessment changes.

* Working groups discussing best approaches to assessments and management.

**Concerns About Small Fishery Size and Data Limitations:**

* Single-species management may be correct in theory but difficult in practice.


* Some species, like paka, migrate and fluctuate in availability over cycles.

* Question raised about whether other regions’ recreational fishing assessments can offer insights.

* Large numbers of recreational fishers make assessments challenging.

**MRIP and Noncommercial Data Collection:**

* Ongoing efforts to refine MRIP data, considering regional and national objectives.

* Some regions acknowledge MRIP’s shortcomings.

* Suggestion to use the bottomfish registry to collect noncommercial data.

* Testing this approach with uku.

**Noncommercial Catch & Catch Limits:**

* Questions about whether noncommercial catch is too high since ACLs haven't been met.

* Concerns that refining noncommercial estimates could impact catch limits.

* Patterns show noncommercial fishers go out only during favorable conditions, while commercial fishers operate year-round.

* Seasonal and cyclical variations in catches noted, particularly for paka.

**Shark Depredation & Fishing Behavior Changes:**

* Increasing shark depredation is affecting fishing behavior.

* Question raised about whether assessments account for these changes.


<u>Bottomfish Vessel Registry (BFVR) Method Presentation by DAR/PIFSC</u>
**Issues with Registration & Catch Estimates:**

* Challenges with boat registration and removing old boats from records.

* The number of boats is easier to track than individual fishers.

* Questions about why noncommercial fishers appear to catch similar amounts as commercial fishers.

* Possible overestimation of noncommercial fishers due to unnecessary registrations.

* Concerns that some fishers register despite not targeting Deep 7.

* Long-standing complaints about reliance on MRIP interviews for catch estimates.


**Underreported Commercial Catch & Data Assumptions:**

* Acknowledgment that commercial catch is underreported across islands.

* Issues with assumptions in data cutoffs used for assessments.

* Suggestion to directly ask BFVR participants about their catches.

* Potential for uku mail survey to help refine data.

<u>Next Steps:</u>

* Proposal to meet in a few weeks to address decision points for analysis.

* New MRIP Approach presentation postponed until next meeting due to time constraints
